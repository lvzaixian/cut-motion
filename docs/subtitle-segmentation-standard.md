# Subtitle Segmentation Standard

This standard is binding for `captionMode: subtitles`. Its purpose is natural one-line reading, not maximum cue count or fixed character packing.

## Authority

Wording priority is:

1. recorded speech and visible delivery;
2. supplied reference script as a terminology and intended-structure candidate;
3. ChatCut ASR and reviewed local fallback.

`state/transcript-reconciliation.json` records every conflict. Neither a script nor ASR may introduce wording the recording does not support.

## Segmentation order

Apply these decisions in order:

1. preserve a complete lexical unit or fixed phrase;
2. choose a clause, syntactic phrase, punctuation, breath, or discourse-reset boundary;
3. keep the cue readable for its acoustic duration;
4. measure the final rendered width and fit it to one line.

Never cut raw text at a character limit before the language pass.

## Blocking rules

- Exactly one rendered line per cue.
- A protected term, product name, number-plus-unit, or fixed phrase cannot cross cues.
- A particle, conjunction, or other function word cannot stand alone. One-character cues are forbidden.
- Do not leave `的`, `了`, `着`, `过`, `啊`, `吧`, `吗`, `呢`, `与`, `和`, `但`, `所以`, `因为`, or `而` as an isolated cue.
- Cue duration is at least 0.5 seconds; normally target 0.8–2.5 seconds.
- Target 4–10.5 measured display units. Allow at most 11.8 units with a documented 88–96px cue-level fit; do not shrink the whole track to solve one phrase.
- A meaningful short closing phrase may be accepted only with an explicit exception reason.
- The concatenated cue text must reproduce the approved transcript after punctuation and spacing normalization.
- Approved cue boundaries cannot change during composition.

## Review workflow

1. Use `state/transcript.json` as authority; `captions/reference-transcript.txt` may exist only as a derived human-readable snapshot.
2. Record names, product configurations, number-unit pairs, and fixed phrases in `captions/caption-lexicon.json`.
3. The Agent authors each semantic cue directly in `captions/caption-review-plan.json` with `text`, `startWordId`, and `endWordId`. Code must not choose or optimize cue boundaries.
4. Validate `captions/caption-review-plan.json` with `scripts/check-caption-review-plan.mjs`.
5. Present every cue in `docs/caption-plan.md` when creative review is triggered.
6. After required user approval or recorded conditional internal approval, the state machine marks the plan approved.
7. Promote that exact plan with `scripts/promote-caption-review-plan.mjs`, validate it, and install it. Do not repaginate during composition.

## Unified input and frame timing

New jobs can author the same decisions once in `planning-inputs.json`: sparse `captionEdits`, confirmed terminology in `corrections`, and explicit ranges only for intentional boundaries. Generation derives the review plan and documents without replacing the language pass. Existing measured caption cards can provide timing without a new CaptionProgram or transcription.

Released cues use half-open integer windows `[startFrame, endFrame)`. Adjacent cues may touch, including fade tails, but cannot overlap. Preserve the job's frame rate and fractional-second snapping fix. Phrase spans are insufficient evidence for internal MG keyword onsets; resolve them before visual-package approval.
