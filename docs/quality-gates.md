# Quality Checks

The default path is human-reviewed and intentionally light. Machine checks establish structure and media integrity; they do not establish semantic correctness, aesthetics, or release readiness.

## Default `review` path

- Keep the original source unchanged.
- Open the ChatCut timeline and wait for the user's rough-cut decision before exporting.
- After approval, export once and run only the basic rough-cut/media lock.
- Reconcile released wording, generate the caption and motion plans, and present the visual arrangement package. Wait for the user's decision before composition. Content analysis and the two cover selections remain prerequisites in the canonical workflow.
- Build the HyperFrames composition, render once, and verify that the delivery has readable video/audio, dimensions, frame rate, duration, and a non-empty file.
- Let the user judge the final captions, MG, timing, semantics, and visual quality.

Do not run the three-threshold rough-cut audit, full snapshot/layout/font/information-value audit, standard-preview comparison, or second encode by default.

## Explicit `auto` / `fallback-auto` checks

The additional three-threshold rough-cut audit and standard-preview comparison run only when the user selects the automatic path or explicitly requests them. Shared checks below still protect approved wording, visual authorities and render inputs in Review mode:

- rough-cut: three silence thresholds, canonical trim finalization, seam checks, and transcript lock;
- transcript/captions: reconciliation, semantic one-line caption plan, caption installation, and timing checks;
- motion: beat-map, visual-plan, HyperFrames contract, font, layout, and information-value checks;
- delivery: detailed render/media receipt when the renderer produces one, plus FFprobe integrity.

Optional snapshots and reports are evidence artifacts, not approval gates. A short preview can be rendered for a specific visual question without changing the workflow state.

## Authority

The recording is authoritative for spoken content. A supplied reference script is immutable reference evidence and must be reconciled before use. ChatCut/ASR supplies timing; HyperFrames owns released captions and motion graphics.

The user owns the final editorial and aesthetic decision. Never summarize passing automated checks as “the video is good.”
