# Caption Modes

## Motion-copy mode

This is the high-density style used by the gold-standard video. Every spoken phrase appears as motion typography. There is no additional caption layer. The beat map must cover every transcript segment exactly.

## Subtitles mode

This is the default release path. Captions carry the complete reconciled spoken content. ChatCut viewer pages provide raw timing evidence; `captions/caption-review-plan.json` is the approved wording, grouping, and boundary authority.

Default 1080×1920 caption treatment:

- 得意黑, locally embedded;
- white `#FFFFFF`;
- 96 px;
- line height 1.15;
- centered;
- 330 px above the bottom edge;
- soft black shadow offset downward;
- exactly one rendered line; target 4–10.5 measured display units and allow up to 11.8 only with the approved 88–96px cue-level fit range;
- lexical units and fixed phrases are protected; particles and conjunctions may not stand alone;
- target one short clause or breath per cue, normally 0.8–2.5 seconds and never below 0.5 seconds;
- no opaque subtitle bar.

Use this sequence:

```bash
node scripts/check-caption-review-plan.mjs jobs/<job-id>/captions/caption-review-plan.json
node scripts/promote-caption-review-plan.mjs jobs/<job-id>
node scripts/check-captions.mjs jobs/<job-id>/captions/captions.json jobs/<job-id>/captions/chatcut-pages.json jobs/<job-id>/state/design-system.json
node scripts/install-captions.mjs jobs/<job-id>/captions/captions.json jobs/<job-id>/hyperframes/index.html jobs/<job-id>/state/design-system.json
```

Before promotion, lock the ChatCut rough cut, reconcile wording against the recording, author semantic one-line cues, and approve them in the creative package. Disable ChatCut caption rendering before exporting clean A-roll. The installer uses only the approved promoted cues and replaces prior generated clips idempotently.

Caption-only HyperFrames is the first publishable result. Only add MG when a selected semantic node closes a viewer cognition gap; place it in the most legible feed-scale focal position rather than mechanically pushing core information to the top or bottom to avoid the face. It must remain local, brief, supplemental, and outside active captions, PiP, evidence, protected UI, and platform chrome. The speaker is not a default protected zone: intentional face coverage is allowed when it improves current semantic understanding. Inspect entrance, peak, hold, and exit at real feed scale, and retain one dominant focal group. Keep the talking-head video full-frame beneath MG by default. A full-screen MG stage with speaker PiP requires explicit user approval. Never add a global MG treatment in this mode.

Creative confirmation calls these treatments **A-axis overlay mode** and **B-axis stage mode**, defines both for the user, and records any B-axis or hybrid choice before approval.

`docs/subtitle-mg-standard.md` is the binding selection rule. A local MG must close a documented viewer cognition gap; merely adding a new fact, technical term, visual stimulus, or subtitle paraphrase is insufficient.
